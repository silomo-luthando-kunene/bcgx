# **Predictive Modeling**
I unsuccessfully tried to build a Random Forest model which I failed at due to not being able to optimise my code and define some metrics needed for the RF model. I used this task as a way to learn how to model and the thought behind writing models to predict certain outcomes with accuracy.
* **Key Deliverable:** Modeling Notebooks.
