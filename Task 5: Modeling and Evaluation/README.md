# **Predictive Modeling:** Proactive Churn Mitigation
**Methodology:** Engineered a Random Forest Classifier optimized through RandomizedSearchCV to navigate the high dimensionality of customer usage and pricing data. This model was chosen for its ability to balance predictive accuracy with "Feature Importance" transparency, which is critical for BCG-level strategic recommendations.

**Performance Metrics:** Achieved an Overall Accuracy of 90% and a strong ROC-AUC of 0.85. Specifically, the model maintains a Precision of 83% for churn predictions, successfully flagging potential churners while minimizing "False Positives" to prevent wasting retention budgets on loyal customers.

**Business Outcome:** The model provides a risk-ranking framework that allows PowerCo to proactively target the top 15% of high-risk customers. By shifting from reactive churn management to predictive intervention, the client can protect significant net margins and stabilize the SME segment.
