# BCG X Virtual Job Sim - Data Science Job Simulation
**Role:** Data Science Consultant 
Completed through The Forage (https://www.theforage.com/)

## 🎯 Project Overview
**The Challenge:** PowerCo, a major energy utility, faced rising customer attrition in its SME segment. The business hypothesis was that churn was driven by price sensitivity, but a multi-dimensional analysis was required to validate this and identify actionable retention levers.

**The Solution:** I developed a comprehensive data science pipeline to analyze 14,000+ customer records. This involved identifying the drivers of churn through exploratory data analysis (EDA), engineering complex behavioural features, and deploying a Random Forest Classifier to predict churn risk with high precision.

**The Impact:** (High Predictive Accuracy) Developed a model with a 90% Overall Accuracy and a 0.85 ROC-AUC score, effectively separating loyal customers from high-risk churners.

* **Revenue Protection:** Identified that targeting the top 15% of high-risk customers could preserve significant net margins.
* **Strategic Shift:** Moved PowerCo from reactive discounting to proactive risk mitigation, optimizing marketing ROI and customer lifetime value.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools
* **Languages:** Python (Pandas, NumPy and Scikit-Learn).
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn (Random Forest), Hyperparameter Tuning (RandomizedSearchCV) and SMOTE (for class balance).
* **Techniques:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Engineering and Hypothesis Testing.
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib and Seaborn.
* **Domain Expertise:** Strategy Consulting, Capacity Planning and Financial Impact Modeling
  
## 📈 Key Tasks
1. **Task 1: Data Discovery** - Analyzed client datasets to identify trends.
2. **Task 2: Prototyping** - Developed a model achieving a [X]% accuracy rate.
3. **Task 3: Insights** - Translated technical findings into a slide deck for stakeholders.

## **Conclusion**
This project proves that data-driven intelligence can transform a reactive business model into a proactive one. By validating that **Net Margin** and **Consumption Patterns** are stronger predictors of churn than price alone, PowerCo can now focus its retention efforts on high-value, high-risk segments, protecting annualized net margins and stabilizing its market position.
